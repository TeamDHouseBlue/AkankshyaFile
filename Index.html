        <p>The fight against coronavirus will not be won until every country in the world can control the disease. But not every country has the same ability to protect people.<br>So this is why we have to find solutions to end this crisis<br><br>

<br> <br>The problem is not that we lack the necessary resources and skills to address the challenges we face. The hitch is that we have tremendous difficulty putting what we have into the combinations we need.        
<br><br>So here are somethings to keep in mind:- <br>
<br> 1. Research shows that wearing masks can reduce transmission of COVID19 by 85%. Individuals should wear masks when in crowded places and indoors to reduce the spread of the virus.  
<br><br>2.Increased testing can help identify more infected individuals. We could isolate and quarantine such individuals to help break the chain and reduce transmission. We can increase testing through the following measures:
<br><br>    a) Increasing sample collection centers and making testing services more accessible will help more individuals get tested.

<br> <br>  b) States should deploy new and novel technologies such as the Tata Feluda test to make testing cheaper, faster, and more accessible.
<br><br> 3. The current surge of the COVID19 epidemic is blamed on the new B.1.617 variant. With genomic sequencing, we can identify new variants of the virus and prevent its spread through targeted interventions.
<br><br> 4. 3.	Remove technology literacy hurdles: The current roll-out favors the technology-literate since any individual needs to use the online platform to get a shot. This has left behind a large section of the population who are not technology literates, such as construction laborers, taxi drivers, and rural elderly.

<br><br>Now coming to Health Infrastructure<br>India’s health budget at 1.28% of the GDP is among the world’s lowest. We need to make targeted and specific investments to solve the COVID crisis:
1.	Triage Protocols: States and hospitals need to develop triage protocols to make the most of available beds, oxygen cylinders, and ventilators
<br><br>
2.	Science-based medicines: The rampant abuse of unproven medicines such as HCQ and ivermectin has caused a false rise in demand and prices. The governments should ensure that science-based medicines are followed.
<br><br>
3.	Proper function of public health centers: Primary health centers are the lifeline of care delivery in rural India. However, due to lack of funding, many remain closed. These have thus prevented many in rural India from accessing proper care and testing services.

<br><br>
4.	Oxygen Transportation Network: Careful monitoring of oxygen transportation can ensure hospitals do not run out of essential oxygen.
<br><br>
5.	Invest in Research & Development: Investment in research can bring out innovative methods and inform public policy to better control the virus.
